# Tinicraft-Minicraft-for-Android
Tinicraft a Minicraft port for android without Ads

I just removed Ads and made some color/visual changes

There are 4 versions (in all Ads are removed)

Tinicraft 1.0.apk
- Which is just original version without Ads

Tinicraft Color Fix 1.0.apk 
- Where i enhanced colors to look more alive while adding shadows and light reflections on some items

Tinicraft Z 1.0.apk
- Where i changed trees to ones from Zelda Link's Awakening + made main character and windows red + slime and it's drop green

Tinicraft ZB 1.0.apk 
- Same as above while character and window colors are blue

Touch controls
- Left side of screen is your virtual joystick. You need to swipe and hold to move (tap and hold won't work)
- Right side of screen is your use button. Tap screen for action/confirm, hold it to open inventory/crafting window
- In inventory/crafting window X on lower right part act as close window button

Gamepad controls (connect your gamepad then enable it in settings)
- You will need to configure gamepad controls after enabling them
- To exit game you first need to open inventory/crafting window, then press right and move down to X icon and hit use button

Works on Nox Player so most likely BlueStacks and other Android emulators will work just fine

Below comparison of version (Blue or Red are either blue or red you see mix of two version on last picture)
